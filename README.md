# cat-vs-dog-

Here we will present a few simple yet effective methods that you can use to build a powerful image classifier, using only very few training examples --just a few hundred or thousand pictures from each class you want to be able to recognize.

#Dataset:

In our examples we will use two sets of pictures, which we got from Kaggle: 1000 cats and 1000 dogs (although the original dataset had 12,500 cats and 12,500 dogs, we just took the first 1000 images for each class). We also use 400 additional samples from each class as validation data, to evaluate our models.
